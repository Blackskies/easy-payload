# easy-payload
Generating payloads on linux with msfvenom is a headache to type commands.
I came up with a bash program to make this easy. Just secect and option, enter IP,Port and payload is generated.
#EASY TO USE 
just type "bash easypayload.sh"
Please make sure that you install METASPLOIT befor you run this Bash script and you have cc compiler.
#Tested on Kali Linux.
